//! Database identity: which databases each environment of an app has,
//! and which database each model runs on.
//!
//! The first is `config/database.yml`, resolved when Roundhouse builds
//! the app (`ingest::database_yml::database_configurations`), the way
//! Rails' `ActiveRecord::DatabaseConfigurations` reads it: the
//! environments, each one's configurations, which is the primary, which
//! are replicas, and the adapter each names. Only the keys that decide
//! identity are read; connection values (host, credentials, pool sizes)
//! are not, so none of them reaches the IR.
//!
//! The second is read from source, never from configuration: a
//! `connects_to` in an abstract class, inherited by its subclasses
//! (`ingest::database_ownership`). Every routing shape the emitted
//! runtime does not carry is a named refusal (`DatabaseRefusal`),
//! reported by `analyze::database_identity`, so an app that needs a
//! database the runtime does not open is reported unsupported instead of
//! silently running on the primary.
//!
//! An app without `config/database.yml` and without routing has none of
//! this, and its IR serializes as before: every field is skipped when
//! empty.
